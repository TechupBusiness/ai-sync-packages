description: Design an agentic workforce structure for solo founders - divisions, org charts, tools, and rollout plans
---

I'm a solo founder. I want to build an agentic workforce that operates like a 100+ person company.

Help me design this from scratch:

1. Based on my product and audience, what should be my moats? 

2. What agent divisions do I need to run? Start with what makes sense now.

3. For each division, what specialized skills should these agents have? Be specific.

4. Build me an org chart. Show reporting lines and workflows between divisions.

5. Define the handoffs. How does work move between specialized agents?

6. What custom internal tools would make each division 10x more effective?

7. Map the tool ecosystem: who uses what, when, why, and how data flows.

8. Create playbooks for each division: approvals, escalation rules, reporting.

9. Design the memory architecture. What should divisions remember to improve?

10. Build feedback loops: how and when  agents flag blockers, and request input.

Finally: Give me a 30-day rollout plan. Which division launches first? 

How do I test, fix gaps, and scale one team at a time? How should repo structures work. What external tools to use as MCPs?

Be practical. I'm building this today, not theorizing. Also let me know how to use Vibeship Spawner & Mind in this.

Use a research skill/tool if available.
