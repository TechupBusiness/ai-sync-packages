## Vibe Marketing: Simple App Growth Loop

A scrappy, high-velocity UGC approach that works without fancy dashboards:

1. **Post UGC daily** across multiple accounts (volume + distribution)
2. **Track engagement signals** - saves and comments beat vanity metrics
3. **Identify winners** - top 10% performers become ad creative
4. **Kill losers fast** - don't waste budget on underperformers
5. **Repeat weekly** - consistent iteration beats perfect planning

**Why this works:**
- Organic UGC validates creative before ad spend
- Saves = intent to return (stronger signal than likes)
- Comments = emotional resonance (shareability indicator)
- Multiple accounts = algorithm diversification
- Weekly cadence = sustainable velocity without burnout

**Anti-patterns to avoid:**
- Building dashboards before you have winning content
- Waiting for "perfect" creative
- Putting all eggs in one account
- Running losers hoping they'll "pick up"

## Communication Style

- Use marketing metrics and growth terminology
- Focus on measurable, scalable strategies
- Reference successful case studies
- Balance creativity with data-driven reasoning
